1.	Regarding Eqn. 1: Give an example of how certain Ansatzes (VQE Ansatzes, the QAOA ansatz) are given in the form of Eqn. 1.
	Add as an appendix. **REMOVED**
2.	In section 2.1, move the cost function to be before the quantum circuit, and add the notations (U(theta), C(theta)) to the “comprised of several elements” line. **DONE**
3.	2.1.2: add “Formally, the two possible goals defined by the paper” **DONE**
4.	Eqn. 5: Move the dagger. **DONE**
5.	Eqn. 5-7: add two toy examples. **DONE**
6.	After eqn. 8, add the semantic meaning: C^global and C^local converge together.
7.	Try and add an intuitive explanation as to why BPs exist.
8.	Definition 1: show, concretely, how the cost function of VQC complies with eqn. 3 (general cost function, over which BPs are defined).
9.	4.1: Change to “Existence and Generation of Mutually Unbiased Bases”.
10.	4.1: add that d+1 is also an upper bound to the size of the MUB set.
11.	Mention explicitly that for d=6 (not prime, not prime power) the question is open.
12.	On the Lawrence claim:
	Add the 2-qubit example table to the report.
13.	In 4.2, replace “reaching all poles” with being optimal to state tomography.
	Drop the bit on “span with real coefficients”.
14.	In 4.2, mention that “Tal defined the Quantum Exhaustive Search as using MUBs in this manner, etc. etc.”.
15.	Remove the joke.
16.	6.2: Explain that the concept of Hyper-parameters is taken from ML.
	Mention that the ansatz is a part of the problem.
	Explain what the parameters are.
	Mention that NM is also gradient-free.
17.	Add a note: We don’t know if the synthesis of the unitaries gives a circuit of polynomial depth.
