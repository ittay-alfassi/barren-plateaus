	abstract = {Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) optimize the parameters \${\textbackslash}vec\{{\textbackslash}theta\}\$ of a parametrized quantum circuit \$V({\textbackslash}vec\{{\textbackslash}theta\})\$ to minimize a cost function \$C\$. While VQAs may enable practical applications of noisy quantum computers, they are nevertheless heuristic methods with unproven scaling. Here, we rigorously prove two results, assuming \$V({\textbackslash}vec\{{\textbackslash}theta\})\$ is an alternating layered ansatz composed of blocks forming local 2-designs. Our first result states that defining \$C\$ in terms of global observables leads to exponentially vanishing gradients (i.e., barren plateaus) even when \$V({\textbackslash}vec\{{\textbackslash}theta\})\$ is shallow. Hence, several VQAs in the literature must revise their proposed costs. On the other hand, our second result states that defining \$C\$ with local observables leads to at worst a polynomially vanishing gradient, so long as the depth of \$V({\textbackslash}vec\{{\textbackslash}theta\})\$ is \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}({\textbackslash}log n)\$. Our results establish a connection between locality and trainability. We illustrate these ideas with large-scale simulations, up to 100 qubits, of a quantum autoencoder implementation.},

We prove that the set of 4N−1 Pauli operators may be partitioned into 2N+1 distinct subsets, each consisting of 2N−1 internally commuting observables. Furthermore, each such partitioning defines a unique choice of 2N+1 mutually unbiased basis sets in the N-qubit Hilbert space. Examples for 2 and 3 qubit systems are discussed with emphasis on the nature and amount of entanglement that occurs within these basis sets.},
