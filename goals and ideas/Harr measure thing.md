Well, looks like we need to understand more on the issue of the Harr Measure and distribution of states.

## Harr Measure
From my understanding, the Harr measure is the measure that describes the distribution Unitary matrices from their general parameters.
That is, to sample a general Unitary, we must apply this measure (kind of acts like a Jacobian) to its values.

The following tutorial is useful as an introduction:

## Concentration of measure

What they're saying is that, if I look at all TRULY randomly chosen state, it will be around the equators with 1-negl. probability?
This is shown by something called Levy's Lemma.
